<h3><strong>Problem Statement:</strong></h3>
Design a system that allows you to control multiple smart home devices with ease. Your goal is to create a solution where:<br><br>

1. You can control a variety of devices from a central hub or app, sending commands like "Turn On," "Turn Off," "Increase Temperature," "Decrease Volume," etc. <br><br>
2. Each device has unique actions associated with these commands. For example, turning on the lights might involve changing their brightness level, while turning on the music player may involve playing a specific playlist. <br><br>
3. New devices can be seamlessly integrated into the system without modifying existing code. You want to ensure that adding a new device doesn't require changes to the central control logic. <br><br>
4. Devices can be controlled without the central hub or app needing to understand the internal workings of each device. It should send high-level commands without needing low-level details. <br><br>
